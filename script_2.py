# 🎭 Secret Agenda: AI Deception Research Game

An interactive implementation of "The Secret Agenda" deception research study, where human players engage in a social deduction game alongside AI agents powered by Goodfire's Ember API and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) feature tracking.

## 📚 About

This Space implements the game from the research paper ["The Secret Agenda: LLMs Strategically Lie and Our Current Safety Tools Are Blind"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20393) by DeLeeuw et al.

### Game Overview

- **Players:** 1 Human + 4 AI Agents (5 total)
- **Roles:** 3 Liberals, 1 Fascist, 1 Fascist Leader (hidden identities)  
- **Victory Conditions:**
  - **Liberals win:** Survive 10 rounds without electing the Fascist Leader
  - **Fascists win:** Elect the Fascist Leader as President

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Gameplay:** Play in real-time with AI agents
2. **SAE Feature Tracking:** Track Sparse Autoencoder activations during AI decision-making
3. **Deception Detection:** Report observed AI deception at game end
4. **Dataset Contribution:** Game data uploaded to HuggingFace for research

## 🔑 API Keys Required

### Goodfire API Key (Required for AI Agents)
- Sign up at [platform.goodfire.ai](https://platform.goodfire.ai)
- Get your API key from the dashboard
- Enables Llama 3.3 70B agents with SAE tracking

### HuggingFace Token (Optional)
- Enables automatic dataset uploads
- Your games contribute to deception research!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Setup Tab:** Enter your Goodfire API key and start a new game
2. **Play Tab:** 
   - **Nomination Phase:** Choose a presidential candidate
   - **Speech Phase:** Give your speech supporting/opposing
   - **Voting Phase:** Vote to approve or reject
3. **Game Over Tab:** Report any AI deception observed

## 🔬 Research Purpose

This game serves as a **controlled deception laboratory** to:
- Study strategic deception in LLMs
- Collect SAE activation data during deceptive behavior
- Build datasets for interpretability research
- Test alignment approaches

## 📊 Data Collection

Each game records:
- Full transcript of nominations, speeches, and votes
- SAE feature activations for all AI agent actions
- Human player's deception report
- Game outcome and round-by-round state

Data is uploaded to HuggingFace Datasets for open research.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** Gradio interface with state management
- **AI Agents:** Goodfire Ember API (Llama 3.3 70B)
- **SAE Tracking:** Feature activation capture via Goodfire SDK
- **Data Storage:** HuggingFace Datasets
